        <h1>A Collective Experience of Chip Shortage for Media Artists</h1>
        <p class="description">
            <strong>The global chip shortage has significantly impacted the electronics industry during the pandemic.</strong> 
            This complex issue is attributed to multiple factors, including supply chain disruptions, geopolitical tensions, and natural disasters. </br>
            
            <strong>Media art has not been spared from the effects of the chip shortage</strong>, as it relies heavily on digital components in its production.
            Microcontrollers like ESP, Raspberry-Pi, Arduino, and various sensors, which are essential for digital art, have also been affected by the shortage.
            <strong>This collective database aims to provide a platform for artists to share their experiences and challenges</strong> in the face of this global phenomenon.</p>
